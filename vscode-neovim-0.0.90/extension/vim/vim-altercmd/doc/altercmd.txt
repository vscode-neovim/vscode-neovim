==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*altercmd-introduction*

*altercmd* is a Vim plugin to provide an easy way to alternate built-in Ex
commands by user-defined Ex commands.  This plugin provides |:AlterCommand|
for this purpose.  For example, if you define :CD, a custom version of |:cd|,
add the following in your vimrc.
>
	AlterCommand cd  CD
<
With the above setting, you can use :cd as if it is :CD.  It means that :CD
will be automatically inserted if you type :cd as an Ex command, so you don't
have to type :CD to use :cd and you'll never encounter mistyping :cd and :CD.

:AlterCommand also supports partial command names.  For example, |:help| can
be invoked with :h, :he, :hel or :help.
>
	AlterCommand h[elp]  HELP
<
With the above setting, you can use :h, :he, :hel and :help as if they are
:HELP, your own version of :help.


Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later

INTERFACE					*altercmd-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*altercmd-commands*

						*:AlterCommand*
:AlterCommand [<buffer>] {original}  {alternative}
			Declare to use {alternative} Ex command instead of
			{original} Ex command.

			If <buffer> is given, this declaration is only
			available for the current buffer.  Otherwise, this
			declaration is available globally.

			See also |altercmd-introduction| for examples.

			Technically, this Ex command does just define some
			|abbreviations| in Command-line mode.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*altercmd-functions*

altercmd#define({original}, {alternative})	*altercmd#define()*
altercmd#define('<buffer>', {original}, {alternative})
			Function version of |:AlterCommand|.

altercmd#load()					*altercmd#load()*
			Load this plugin.  You have to call this in your vimrc
			if you want to use |:AlterCommand| in your vimrc.




==============================================================================
BUGS						*altercmd-bugs*

- Not all cases are supported.  For example:

  - [range] is not supported yet.  If [range] is given, altercmd doesn't work.

  - If any argument is not given to an Ex command which has an alternative Ex
    command, altercmd doesn't work.

  - And there may be more cases where altercmd doesn't work well.




==============================================================================
